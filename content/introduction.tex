\Section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, there has been a pronounced interest in understanding the
phenomenology of the new particle and especially the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. One of the parameters
that determines the shape of Higgs potential is the trilinear self-coupling of the Higgs boson $\lambda_{HHH}$,
which is directly accessible via di-Higgs production~\cite{CMS:2021qbp, HandbookLHC}. Of particular interest is the fact that beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories
predict very different di-Higgs behavior, some of which differ markedly from predictions of the Standard Model (SM).
Contributions from BSM effects may significantly increase di-Higgs production and influence the di-Higgs phenomenology. Therefore, precise
measurements of di-Higgs processes and tests of SM predictions can increase our understanding of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism~\cite{HandbookLHC}. \\

The $HH \rightarrow b \bar{b} \gamma \gamma$ is one of the most sensitive decay channels of di-Higgs production, since the decay of one Higgs boson
to two bottom quarks has a large branching fraction and the two photons produced by the second Higgs boson can be detected with an excellent mass resolution.
Furthermore, in this decay channel, the background is comparatively low~\cite{CMS:2021qbp}, so the signal can be measured with good precision.
Nevertheless the signal-background classification
is a challenging task, which is performed by constructing physics-motivated variables and applying selection cuts on the various objects to reduce the background.
In this thesis the signal-background classification using a deep neural network is studied. \\

The thesis is structured as follows. In Section \ref{sec:theory}, the role of the Higgs boson in the SM, HH production
and the CMS detector are introduced. In Section \ref{sec:prep}, the event selection and variables used to distinguish signal from background are presented.
The architecture of the MLP is introduced in Section \ref{sec:deepl} and in Section \ref{sec:results} the results of the signal-background classification using the MLP are presented.
In section \ref{sec:conclusion}, the results of this work are summarized and an outlook on future research opportunities is given.
