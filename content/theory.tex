\subsection{The Higgs boson in the Standardmodel}

The standardmodel of particle physics describes three of the four elementary forces, explains which particles can participate in which interactions and which exchange particles are
used to transfer the forces. The question of what gives elementary particles their mass remained unanswered for a long time. With the discovery of the Higgs boson, this mechanism was
experimentally proven for the first time. \\




% The Standardmodel of particle physics describes the strong, weak and electromagnetic interaction and introduces the elementary particles. The elementary particles are grouped into 
% fermions, which include all quarks and leptons, and bosons, which carry the elemntary forces. The SM predicts that the vector bosons and fermions are massless, but in fact their masses can be measured.
% The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism solves this contradiction: The discovered Higgs boson creates a symmetric scalar field $V$ with an asymmetric minimum at $v=246 GeV$. 
% Because of the radial symmetry of the Higgs field, there are multiple lowest-energy states. When a particle couples to the Higgs field, one of these states is entered 
% and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This adds interaction terms in the Lagrangian of the Higgs field which then lead to mass terms for the fermions and vector bosons.
% Through this mechanism a mass for fermions and vector bosons is assigned without breaking the global symmetry of the Higgs field.


\subsection{Higgs boson pair production}
\label{sec:sig_processes}

There are two main production modes for di-Higgs and therefore for $HH \rightarrow b \bar{b} \gamma \gamma$: Vector boson fusion (VBF) and gluon gluon fusion (ggF). 
The feynman graphs contributing to VBF are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:1}, the feynman graphs for ggF are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:2}. \\

These production modes allow access to five different couplings, where $\lambda_{HHH}$ and $y_t$ belong to SM processes and $c_2$, $c_{2g}$ and $c_{g}$ only occur in BSM processes.
$\lambda_{HHH}$ describes the trilinear self-coupling of the Higgs boson and $y_t$ the top Yukawa coupling. The interaction between two Higgs bosons and two top quarks is described by $c_2$,
$c_{2g}$ is the coupling between two Higgs bosons and two gluons and  $c_{g}$ describes the interaction between Higgs bosons and gluons.
Deviations from the SM expectations
can be parametrized through $\kappa_{\lambda} := \lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}$ and $\kappa_{t} := y_{t}/y_{t}^{SM}$~\cite{CMS:2021qbp}. 

\subsection{The CMS detector}
\label{sec:cms_det}

% The CMS detector which is operated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN sits around 100m underground, has a length of 21.6m and a diameter of 14.6m.
The centerpiece of the CMS detector is the 4-T superconducting soleoid, which allows track reconstruction of high energetic particles. The inner tracker,
the electric calorimeter (ECAL) and the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) are placed inside the coil. The muon chambers are located outside the coil and are embedded in the steel return yokes~\cite{CMS:2008}. \\

The ECAL is made of 75 848 lead tungstate (PbWO$_4$) crystals which are mounted in the barrel and the two endcaps of the ECAL. The photodetectors need to be fast, able to operate in the magnetic field and
resistant to radiation and particles that pass through them. To meet these requiremets the photodetectors in the barrel are avalanche photodiodes (APDs), in the endcap vacuum phototriodes (VPT) are used.
The Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL) is placed outside the ECAL and constits of 70 000 tiles of scintillators~\cite{CMS:2008}. \\

Only a small amount of collisions is from physical interest: In order to select the relevant events a two level trigger system is used. The first level trigger (L1) is implemented in the hardware of CMS and filters the events
within $4 \mu$s. The regional calorimeter trigger (RCT) takes into account data from the ECAL, HCAL and muon chambers and calculates regional quantities, e. g. $E_T$ sums. The global trigger (GT) processes the inputs fron the RCT,
sorts candidates built by the RCT and calculates global quantities like $E_T^{miss}$. The second trigger level (High level trigger, HLT) applies selection cuts on the objects of events that passed the L1 so that only those events which
are of interest for data analysis are kept~\cite{CMS:2017trg}. \\

The algorithm that reconstructs objects based on the signature left in the detector is called particle-flow (PF). The PF algorithm combines the collected data from different detector areas and summarizes signatures that are so close to
each other that they probably originated from the same particle or the same jet into so-called superclusters. To identify jets the information from the ECAL and HCAL are sufficient; isolated photons or electrons are identified by clustering in the ECAL~\cite{CMS:2017pf}.
